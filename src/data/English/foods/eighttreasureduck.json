		"description": "A dish that needs true skills to make. Your eyes ache by the time you finish removing all the bones. It seems this dish has proved a test not only for your knife skills but also for your physical endurance and patience. Shame, then, that the duck, so carefully arranged, practically blew apart inside the pan... Forget about trying this again. Just close your eyes and take it easy for a bit."

Add fragrant gravy and a touch of rosy gloss, and this can be said to be the perfect combination of color, flavor, and shape, every bite a veritable flood of flavor with an enduring aftertaste."
